## About the repo: 
This repo was made for my installation of Arch Linux my way. Even so, I decided to separate the installation from the customizations that I normally do on the system.
[Install.md](https://github.com/luismacena19/arch_installation_btrfs_luks/blob/main/Install.md) is the installation itself and [AfterParty.md](https://github.com/luismacena19/arch_installation_btrfs_luks/blob/main/AfterParty.md) is the customization file.
In the future I intend to create an interactive script to install the system, but that will be for the future.
